# In this file please complete the following tasks:
#
# Task 4 [3] The curse of k
# Independent inquiry time! Picking the right number of neighbours k in the kNN approach is tricky.
# Find a way you could approach this more rigorously.
# In comments, state the approach you could use, and provide a reference to it.
# The reference needs to be to a handbook or peer-reviewed publication; a link to an online tutorial
# will not be accepted.


# Task 6 [3] I can do better!
# Independent inquiry time! There are much better approaches out there for image classification.
# Your task is to find one, and using the comment section of your project, do the following:
# •	State the name of the approach, and a link to a resource in the Cardiff University library that describes it
# •	Briefly explain how the approach you found is better than kNN in image classification (2-3 sentences is enough).
